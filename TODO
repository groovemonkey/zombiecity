Next Items On The To-Do List:
	
-when you enter a building, a new grid/room is generated. Your currentlocation isn't updated to reflect that, which might be the problem.
	-try doing room generation earlier? Or eliminating an "extra room" that's generated for single-room buildings like :hairdresser?
	-BUGFIX? -- right after room creation, add the generated room name onto the end of the player's currentlocation?
	
	
- ADD FURNITURE AND ITEMS FOR AUTO-GENERATION TESTING!!!

Minor: 
- core/generate-room - fill containers?


#################
IF ON GRIDPOINT:

"West, you see a an apartment building."
(typing 'west' gets me to the apartment building without having to type "buildings -- west -- apartment-building")


#################
IF IN BUILDING: you can't just be in a building.  You have to be on a sub-building grid (either a building gridpoint or a unit gridpoint ('room'))

#################
IF IN ROOM:

"You're standing in a <room-type>. You can see
-a dresser
-a bookcase
-a <xyz>"

#################
IMPLEMENT 'search' command:

searching a given item runs a check to make sure that our current location 'contains' this function (using 'is-object-here?').
