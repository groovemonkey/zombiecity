sample 'moving through the world' functionality:

-I start on a gridpoint, and see some "buildings" in different directions:

#################
IF ON GRIDPOINT:

"West, you see a an apartment building."
(typing 'west' gets me to the apartment building without having to type "buildings -- west -- apartment-building")


#################
IF IN BUILDING: you can't just be in a building.  You have to be on a sub-building grid (either a building gridpoint or a unit gridpoint ('room'))

#################
IF IN ROOM:

"You're standing in a <room-type>. You can see
-a dresser
-a bookcase
-a <xyz>"

#################
IMPLEMENT 'search' command:

searching a given item runs a check to make sure that our current location 'contains' this function (using 'is-object-here?').
