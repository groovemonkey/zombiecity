Next Items On The To-Do List:

- abstracting the 'buildings' --> 1, 2, 3 crap. 
	-BUGFIX? Maybe by creating a SET of 5 randomly rolled building-types? that way if it repeats, it won't be stored in the set/map?

-when you enter a building, a new grid/room is generated.
	-1: fix generated grid for multi-unit buildings (output is in test.clj)
	-when you enter, you have to do "move :building-name" TWICE to get inside.
	-try doing room generation earlier? Or eliminating an "extra room" that's generated for single-room buildings like :hairdresser?
	-BUGFIX? -- right after room creation, add the generated room name onto the end of the player's currentlocation?
	
- when you're in a room, it treats items like other locations; throws up when trying to treat an item description as a map.
	-BUGFIX? some kind of check to make sure the thing we're about to list is in the official roomtypes map?
	
	
- gameplay: roll for a zombie-encounter every time you change gridpoints? YEAH!
	
	
	
- ADD FURNITURE AND ITEMS FOR AUTO-GENERATION TESTING!!!

Minor: 
- core/generate-room - fill containers?


#################
IF IN BUILDING: you can't just be in a building.  You have to be on a sub-building grid (either a building gridpoint or a unit gridpoint ('room'))

#################
IF IN ROOM:

"You're standing in a <room-type>. You can see
-a dresser
-a bookcase
-a <xyz>"

#################
IMPLEMENT 'search' command:

searching a given item runs a check to make sure that our current location 'contains' this function (using 'is-object-here?').
